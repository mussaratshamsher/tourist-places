    <h2>Beaches</h2> 
<p>Coming to Karachi and not starting by visiting the beach? Big Mistake. Karachi has the most beautiful beaches that you can visit and enjoy the cool sea breeze with a picnic spread.
The closes to the city are the Clifton Sea View, which is always overcrowded and is also affected in terms of water pollution ever since the oil leak in 2003. However, the best beach sides with clean water and sand are Nathiagali Beach, Sand‚Äôs Pit, Hawk‚Äôs Bay, French Beach etc.
Besides the beautiful view of the waves crashing, you can enjoy horse and camel riding with your family. In addition to these, you can also try buggy rides and bikes to get the full sand experience.
